Paddy, a self-proclaimed coding enthusiast, is currently on a mission to become a full-stack developer. He spends his days tinkering with Node.js, Golang, and dabbling in the world of machine learning. When he's not glued to his computer screen, you can find him trying to convince his cat to learn how to code with him. Paddy firmly believes that the key to success is a good interpersonal skill, a strong cup of coffee, and a never-ending supply of Stack Overflow tabs.
